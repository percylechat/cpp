// For every exercise, your main must test everything.
// Constructors and destructors of each class must have specifics output.
// Create a simple and complete base class Animal.
// The animal class got one protected attribute:
// â€¢std::string type;
// Create a class Dog that inherits from Animal.
// Create a class Cat that inherits from Animal.
// (for the animal class the type can be left empty or put at any value).
// Every class should put their name in the Type field for example:
// The Dog class type must be initialized as "Dog".
// Every animal must be able to use the method makeSound().
// This method will display an appropriate message on the standard outputs based on the
// class.
