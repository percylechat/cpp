// Upon construction Dog and Cat will initialize their Brain* with a new Brain();
// Upon destruction Dog and Cat will delete their Brain.
// Your main will create and fill an Array of Animal half of it will be Dog and the other
// half will be Cat.
// Before exit, your main will loop over this array and delete every Animal.

// A copy of a Cat or Dog must be "deep".
// Your test should show that copies are deep!
// Constructors and destructors of each class must have specifics output.
